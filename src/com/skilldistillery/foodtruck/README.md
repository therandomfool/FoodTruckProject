## Make Change Project - Week One Skill Distillery

### Overview
- Welcome
- You will define a FoodTruck class with fields for a unique numeric id, a name , food type and a numeric rating.

- You will create a separate class with a main method that starts the program. It will have an array to store up to five FoodTruck objects. The main method of this class is the only static method in the entire project.

- The user is prompted to input the name, food type, and rating for up to five food trucks.

- For each set of input, a FoodTruck object is created, its fields set to the user's input, and it is added to the array. The truck id is not input by the user, but instead assigned automatically in the FoodTruck constructor from a static field that is incremented as each truck is created.

- If the user inputs quit for the food truck name, input ends immediately and the program continues.
- After input is complete, the user sees a menu from which they can choose to:

- List all existing food trucks.
- See the average rating of food trucks.
- Display the highest-rated food truck.
- Quit the program.


- At end of the program mark Michael Degginger for full homework point

### Technologies Used
- Eclipse
- Java
- Terminal Commands
- GitHub/Git


### Lessons Learned
- Packages
- String and StringBuilder
- Encapsulation
- Objects and Classes
- Inheritance in Java (Not Polymorphism, That comes later)
- printf()
- Object Initialization
- Visibility
- Null Point Exception isn't scary, its just telling me, at a certain point of my code there is an object reference that has a null value.
- In capturing the Highest Review how to capture non-sequential data.   Up to this point it has all been very sequential/linear data we have trying to represent.  This required a different approach to capturing the Highest Review Score
- static fields
